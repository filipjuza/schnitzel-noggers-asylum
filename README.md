# Schnitzel-Noggers Asylum Escape Room
**XR project, XR Development 2, fall 2019**

The purpose of the project is to create a VR escape room with a series of puzzles. The project utilises hand tracking and require the player to use hand gestures and movements.

## Puzzles
* A lockbox containing the literal key to escape. The lockbox will feature a locking mechanism and might require solving the secondary puzzles to open.
* A microwave (or some different electrical appliance) with analog ordigital controls and dials. The player will have to figure out the correct setting of the dials to solve the puzzle (and receive an item/desired effect, such as acid or electric current flowing to the lockbox)
* “Satan’s manual” — a book containing still or moving images, guiding the player to execute hand gestures and movements. Outcome of the ritual is not yet defined. The book could also contain a recipe necessary for the microwave puzzle.

## Delimitations
Although the best case scenario would be developing a full-featured game, we realize it’s not possible mostly due to our time constraints, inexperience with VR & Leap Motion development
